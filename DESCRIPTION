Description: Extracting subsets of data from dist objects can be challenging. Existing functionality makes it possible to extract individual distances using the one dimensional index corresponding to a pair of observations. Alternatively, a dist object can be coerced into a matrix. However, this doubles the amount of memory required for storage. 'disttools' provides convenient methods for accessing the data in dist objects without increasing memory or computational overhead.
